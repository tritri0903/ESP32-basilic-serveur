Welcome to the ESP32 Basilic Serveur repository, a versatile project for building your own basil garden with automated care capabilities. This project is designed for the ESP32 microcontroller and provides a web interface for monitoring and controlling your basil plants.

## Overview

Basilic Serveur leverages the capabilities of the ESP32 microcontroller to create an automated basil garden. With a web-based interface, you can track vital statistics about your basil plants, such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. Additionally, you can control the garden's environment by adjusting parameters like LED lighting and water pumps.

## Features

- **Web Interface**: Access your basil garden's data and controls through a user-friendly web interface.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Keep tabs on critical environmental factors, including temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.
- **Remote Control**: Adjust garden conditions remotely, such as turning on LED lights or activating the water pump.
- **Automated Care**: Set up automated routines to ensure your basil plants receive consistent care.
- **Data Logging**: Store historical data to analyze your basil garden's performance over time.

## Installation

To set up your own basil garden with ESP32 Basilic Serveur, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tritri0903/ESP32-basilic-serveur.git
```

2. Open the Arduino IDE and load the project. Make sure you have the required libraries installed (listed in the project's README).

3. Connect your ESP32 board and upload the code.

4. Access the web interface through your ESP32's IP address (displayed in the Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor).

## Usage

Using the ESP32 Basilic Serveur is straightforward:

1. Connect the necessary sensors to your ESP32 board.

2. Access the web interface via your browser to monitor your basil garden.

3. Adjust settings and controls as needed to provide the best care for your basil plants.

4. Analyze historical data to optimize your basil garden's performance.
